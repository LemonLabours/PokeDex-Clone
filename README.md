# PokeDex-Clone

This repository contains a SwiftUI project that serves as a clone of the PokeDex app, designed by Maria Julia Barbieri from Behance. The project was developed as an exercise for the Tuwaiq Swift Bootcamp, focusing on SwiftUI concepts and best practices.

## Features

- **User Interface Design**: The app closely follows the captivating design created by Maria Julia Barbieri, capturing the essence of the PokeDex app with its visually appealing layout, vibrant colors, and intuitive navigation.

- **Local JSON Data**: The app utilizes a local JSON file to store information about different Pokémon. The JSON file acts as a data source, enabling users to access and view the details of various Pokémon species.

- **Search and Filter**: Users can search for specific Pokémon by name or apply filters based on their type, abilities, or other attributes. This functionality makes it easier for users to find and explore Pokémon of interest.

- **Create and Delete Functions**: The clone includes a create function that allows users to add new Pokémon to their collection. Users can input the necessary details, such as name, type, abilities, and more. Additionally, a delete function enables users to remove Pokémon from their collection when desired.

- **Pokémon Details**: Tapping on a Pokémon card reveals comprehensive details about the chosen Pokémon, including its abilities, characteristics, and evolutionary chain. Users can gain a deeper understanding of each Pokémon and its unique traits.

- **User-Friendly Experience**: The app focuses on providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience. It incorporates smooth animations, responsive interactions, and intuitive gestures, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the app.
